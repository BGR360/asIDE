## Reporting Bugs

I very happily encourage you to report any bugs you encounter with asIDE so I can fix them.


### What to include in your bug report
1. **Description:** Give a good description of the problem so that I know what's wrong.
2. **System Specs:** Tell me what operating system (and version) you were using when the bug occurred.
3. **Steps to Reproduce:** It's much easier for me to fix things if you tell me how I can reproduce the bug.
4. **Dank Memes:** They help me work faster. Not expressly necessary.

### How to report bugs
